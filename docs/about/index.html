<p>This is a blog by me, Matt Piekenbrock. My background and research interest are listed on my <a href="https://mattpiekenbrock.com">homepage</a> and my software projects are primarily listed on my <a href="https://github.com/peekxc">github</a>. The topics of this blog span many topics, typically in the area of programming, math, algorithms, data analysis, and graphics/visualization.</p>
<p>Everything on here is my own opinion and does not reflect the views of any other person, organization, or entity I'm associated with.</p>
<p>My research interests lie mostly at the intersection between Topological Data Analysis (TDA), data science, and scientific computing. I love learning about open-ended areas of learning theory and data analysis, things like unsupervised learning, clustering, dimensionality reduction, estimation theory, and so on. I'm also a <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#abstract">modern C++</a> enthusiast, and believer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>, and a fervent supporter of open source software.</p>

<!-- When I entered college, like every well-educated person in the world, I found out the world is just incredibly complicated. In fact, still to this day, 
I'm amazed by so many things I learn.   
Having had a very classical computer science curricula in college, I appreciate the . Math is often abstract, hard, and obtuse.
I see statistics is brings math into the world of possibilities. 
Computer scientists make the I come up with a lot of crazy ideas. Most of which are illogical, and completely based on intuition. 
The purpose of this site is act as an outlet for the crazy things I come up with. Programming, to me, is fundamentally
an obfuscated subset of mathematics: ultimately, we are just encoding logic into symbols. Of course, mathematics 
is much more concise, but at heavy cost of losing _context_. 

Per the name, much of the content is focused discussing topics in the programming or data science world, or relatives thereof. Part of the reason for this is also to share interesting insights about my research, and present understandable summaries for the general public.

One of the primary motivations for this blog is to attempt to use of probability and statistics (P&S) properly in such topics; in even the most important discussions in society today, PS is either absent or misrepresented. Most [lawyers consider P&S to be useless](). We **need** amazing projects such as [the innocence project]() to exist, because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the risk associated with false-positive rates in convictions, and in the misuse of DNA evidence. One need only turn on the news to see the widespread misintepretation of research results, such as the (staged) research study on whether [chocolate increased metabolism, which could help you lose weight](https://io9.gizmodo.com/i-fooled-millions-into-thinking-chocolate-helps-weight-1707251800).

The secondary motivation for this effort is more personal. I've often observed between my politically-oriented colleagues that neither side seems ameneable to conceding discussion points to the other. At best, the discussions are civil, leading to an "agree to disagree" junction, possibly due to _lack of data_ or disagreement on the _bias_ of reported statistics. At worst, the discussions are emotionally-driven, and progress towards mutual understanding seems impossible. Either way, the mobility of most discussions I see staggers, and both sides end leaving even more polorized than when the discussion began. This seems to have also occurred at the national scale between followers of the two primary political parties, [with help from Russian hackers](). 

But discussions don't have to be polarizing, and reasonable conclusions mutually agreed on by everyone can be reached. The tool I choose to use to facilitate this is probability. John Hartigan, a legendary statistician who was far ahead of his time, [once had a interview published](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Conferences/Stats2009/AConversationwithJohnHartigan.pdf) on his thoughts on various topics in probability theory. He was asked:   -->
<!-- John Hartigan is a remarkable statistician who was at the forefront of actually do real statistics on real data, before the datasets grew to their enormous size they are today and ML became so renowned. 

He [once had a interview published](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Conferences/Stats2009/AConversationwithJohnHartigan.pdf) on his thoughts on various topics in probability theory. The interviewer asked him: _But if somebody disagreed with you about the probability of an event, how would you engage them in argument?_ His response was as follows:

> Hartigan: Consider the probability that President Bush will be reelected. I wouldn’t say "it's 0.3 and that's the end of it." I would say it is 0.3 for these reasons and, if he wanted to disagree with me, I would expect him to produce reasons, and I should listen to those reasons and maybe change my probability. That's alright, because probability should depend on knowledge and, in fact, one of the reasons that we engage in argument is to extract knowledge. So I would go through what I regard as all the relevant facts for the possibility of President Bush being reelected and I would try to weight them. Now how you do that exactly is pretty hard I agree. Nevertheless in principle I think that is the way you should go about it. 

This response really highlights the quintesseintaal essence of probability. Probability can be studied rigorously, anlytically, by making assumptions about the underlying distribution and then proceeding. In this sense, probability reduces to just the study of measurable functions and their corresponding supports. 

> Now this person might come and say, "No it's 0.7 and that's the end of it." (Laughter.) I would say, "No, it's not the end of it. Tell me why," and if he refuses to tell me why, then I regard that as an inadequate argument. I would expect him to say that these are my reasons and I might say, "Yes, I didn't think of that. I will change my probability," and I would expect him to address my reasons, to say, "No, you shouldn’t take any notice of those reasons." I can’t see why there shouldn’t be a reasonable argument about these things.

I think his sentiments highlight an attitude that many people have today. Indeed, there _are_ many people (some who've I had the pleasure of meeting!) who approach heated topics reasonably. Yet, for one reason or another, the complexity of the topic hinders progress, and mobility with respect to changing viewpoints staggers.  -->
<!-- ## A solution?

These are issues, however, that can be solved with probability and statistics. Data sets are becoming increasingly available by the day. There are tools for handling [_statistical bias_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_(statistics)). There are predictive models which have explicitly stated [assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias), assumptions which can be [empirically tested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing). It is true that many people encounter mathematical anxiety when it comes to statistics. I think the hypothetical data set described by [SPSS tutorial on factor analysis](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/seminars/introduction-to-factor-analysis/a-practical-introduction-to-factor-analysis/) sums up the more common reasons. 

But I genuinely believe the field of P&S truly contains the tools and knowledge to address the hindrances to such discussions. I quote Hartigan again in this regard: _""_.  Moreover, I believe that if presented correctly, using P&S can be fascinating and rewarding way to live.  -->
